        "*   The performance of a RAG system is strongly dependent on the relevant data the retriever is able to identify. This makes the process of data chunking and retrieval very crucial. More advanced methods of data extraction and chunking can implemented by using services such as the [Unstructured API](https://unstructured.io/).   \n",
        "*   The chunk size can also be varied along with the distance metric. This implementation has used `cosine distance` but other metrics such as `Euclidean distance` can also be used. This hyperparameter can be changed in the pinecone console.\n",
        "*   RAGAS is a very helpful tool and has streamlined the process of benchmarking the RAG systems. This does come at the cost of using OpenAI's closed source ecosystem. While RAGAS does allow you to use your custom LLM model, at the time of developing this usecase, it isn't working with both local LLM solutions (Ollama) and hosted LLMs (VertexAI). The library also requires the data to be in a very specific format including the names of the columns in the dataset.  \n",
        "*  The rag system is currently only using a single master circular. There are more circulars available on [SEBI's official website](https://www.sebi.gov.in/sebiweb/home/HomeAction.do?doListing=yes&sid=1&ssid=6&smid=0) here."
